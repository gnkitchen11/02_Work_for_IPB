# What does it mean to have objects masked from packages?
#
# For example:
#
#Attaching package: ‘dplyr’
#
The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:
#
#    filter, lag
#
#The following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:
#
#    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
#
#
#Attaching package: ‘chron’
#
#The following objects are masked from ‘package:lubridate’:
#
#   days, hours, minutes, seconds, years
#
#The warning is telling me that in loading a package a dataframe has been made
#available and that the dataframe has a column name (variable name) that is in 
#conflict with a function name in a package. If the dataframe column name is not 
#masked from the package, you would have a problem using the package.
#This is a result of the way R searches for objects.
