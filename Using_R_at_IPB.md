### This markdown file is to describe how I use R at International Paperbox

The purpose of this file is to orient anyone that may need to understand
the data analysis and reporting system that I have built around R
at International Paperbox (IPB).

So the goal is to quickly orient someone with the aim to minimize turnover
costs when someone may need to take over managing the data analysis and
reporting on production and management processes.
